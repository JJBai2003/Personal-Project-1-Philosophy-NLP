# Personal-Project-1-Philosophy-NLP

## Project Description:
This is a NLP model that determines which philosopher's(Socrates, Aristotle, Stoic, Sceptist,Epicurean) ideology a sentence most closely resembles. 



### Motivation
Last semester, I took my first official Philosophy course for my minor called Greek and Roman Philosophy. We learned about Socrates, Aristotle and other Hellenistic philosphers. It was a great experience seeing how different philosophers view the soul, body and nature differently.
Also last semester, as a part of the XMP(Xenophobic Meters Project) of Cornell Hack4Impact, I familiarized myself with the concept of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. As a team, we built models that analyze tweets based on how xenophobic the contents are. The labels we used are 1,0, and -1 corresponding to non-xenophobic(pro-foreigner), neutral and xenophobic. 
With interests in these two fields, I wanted to develop an NLP model that can determine which philosopher's ideology a sentence most closely supports. Hence, this personal project.
